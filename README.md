# Studio-Infocus website
This is a presentation website that promotes a young photographer's work and skills in Timisoara.

## Project structure
```
1. Landing page 
   - points to pages 2, 3 and 4
2. Portfolio page - shooting sections of:
    - events
    - art
    - products
    - macro focused
    - urbex
3. Services
    - logo design
    - shootings to own like
    - details about both and maybe price plans
4. Contact
   - simple email box
   - instagram

Every page will have a nav header and a footer that contains social media and stuff like that.
```

### Code quality requirements
```
- Will use Bootstrap, JS and raw HTML/CSS where necessary.
- Apply clean code standards where possible.
- Database agnostic or maybe use a PHP database for user reusability.
```
