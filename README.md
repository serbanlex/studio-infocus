# Studio-Infocus website
This is a presentation website that promotes a young photographer's work and skills in Timisoara.<br>
The site is available [here](https://studioinfocus.ro/).


### Code quality requirements
```
- Will use Bootstrap, JS and raw HTML/CSS where necessary.
- Apply clean code standards as much as possible.
- Work through pair programming and individual tasks.
- Database agnostic or maybe use a PHP database for user reusability.
```
